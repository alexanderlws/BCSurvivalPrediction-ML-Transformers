# Breast Cancer Survival Prediction with Machine Learning and Transformers

Breast cancer survival prediction using different machine learning models and Transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT).
The reposititory consist of 2 sections mainly the Machine Learning models in R environment and Transformer models in Python environment.

For R source codes:
1. Run cr_val.r [Training + Evaluation of ML Models]
2. Run roc_scoring_V3.r [plotting the AUC-ROC graph]

For Python source codes:
1. Run main.py from the automodel folder [Consist of Training+Evaluation of Transformer Models]
